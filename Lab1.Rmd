## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Loading the Data 
```{r}
load("~/mids_w203_lab01/ceo_w203.RData")

# Different views of the dataset
head(CEO)
str(CEO)
```

# Adding a Visualization package
```{r,echo =FALSE}
library("ggplot2")
```

# Histogram plot of the dependent variable, salary
```{r}
salary_hist <- ggplot(data = CEO, aes(x = salary))
salary_hist + geom_histogram(bins = 40)

```
The histogram of the dependent variable salary uncovers two important features about the salary sample. First, the distribution has a positive skew, with many salaries bunched into bins between 500 and 1000 and a long tail towards the right. Second, there are two or more possible outliers. From this evidence, we believe that distribution for salary is non-normal and may require transformation, especially if we are to use models that assume normally distributed variables.
